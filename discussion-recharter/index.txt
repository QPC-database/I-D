1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list was chartered [RFC3005] to '[further] the
   development and specification of Internet technology through
   discussion of technical issues, and [host] discussions of IETF
   direction, policy, meetings and procedures.'  It is thus considered
   the primary venue where the operation of the IETF is discussed.

   This draft contends that the IETF discussion list is not fit for
   these purposes, and makes recommendations that follow from that
   conclusion.

   In particular, it argues that the IETF discussion list is not
   representative of the IETF community as a whole (Section 2), and that
   the IETF discussion list is toxic Section 3.  In combination, these
   factors make it a poor venue for the matters it is chartered to host.
   Section 4 therefore makes recommendations for changes that address
   these issues.

   Note that this document does not advocate closing the IETF discussion
   list.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The IETF discussion list is not representative

   The IETF discussion list is often said to be the place where the IETF
   community as a whole comes together.  Discussion there often
   influences decisions made about the direction of the organisation as
   a whole, and occasionally about specific technology choices.

   It is difficult to measure how representative the IETF discussion
   list is.  One way to approximate it is to compare its membership with
   other IETF lists.  Although this has many limitations (e.g., some may
   use different addresses; some may have subscribed and then disabled
   delivery rather than unsubscribing; generally, subscription to a
   mailing list is only a weak proxy for participation in the IETF), it
   is nevertheless illuminating.

   As of writing, the IETF discussion list has 1,751 members who have
   made their e-mail address public; 29 members have not made their
   addresses public.

   Comparing its membership to that on other various IETF mailing lists,
   we find that there are typically a large number of members that are
   not participating on the IETF discussion list:

   When combined, the lists above have a total of 5,355 unique addresses
   subscribed; only 628 (11.7%) of them are on the IETF discussion list.

   Another lens to examine the IETF discussion list with is in the
   proportion of RFC authors who are subscribed to it.  Again, this has
   many shortcomings, but can nevertheless help to inform as to how
   representative the IETF discussion list is.

   As of 11 August 2020, the RFC Editor queue contained 167 drafts,
   which had a total of 352 unique author addresses.  Of that group, 83
   (23.6%) are also members of the IETF discussion list.

3.  The IETF discussion list is toxic

   [RFC3005] also specifies that 'considerable latitude is allowed' in
   what is considered acceptable on this mailing list.

   This latitude has helped to make it difficult for the community to
   come to agreement about the boundaries of discussion.  [RFC3005]
   empowers the IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director or a sergeant-
   at-arms (SAA) appointed by the Chair to 'restrict posting by a
   person, or of a thread, when the content is inappropriate and
   represents a pattern of abuse.'

   Subsequently, the SAA developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SoP)
   in consultation with the community, in an effort to assure that the
   community understood how this power would be used, that it was used
   in a fair and non-discriminatory fashion, and so that participants
   had more confidence about what was appropriate for the list.

Internet-Draft   De-Chartering the IETF Discussion List      August 2020


   When that power was recently exercised, there was considerable
   pushback within the community about its use, and the IETF Chair
   directed the SAA to rescind the restriction.

   Without examining the issue as to whether it was appropriate for the
   SAA to use their power to restrict posting in that instance, this
   incident has made it clear that the tools available to the SAA to
   guide the nature of the discussion - even once it's declared to be
   off-topic - are blunt.  The mechanisms in [RFC3005] are not adequate
   to reasonably guide discussion on this list to be productive, and as
   a result anecdotal evidence suggests that several participants are
   choosing to leave it.

4.  Recommendations

   This document updates [RFC3005] by recommending that:

   1.  The IESG should not consider the IETF discussion list as an
       appropriate venue for notifying IETF participants of its actions
       or items under consideration.  More suitable channels include the
       IETF Announcements list and the GENDISPATCH Working Group,
       depending on the nature of the notification.

   2.  The IESG should not consider discussion on the IETF discussion
       list as representative of the broader IETF community.  As noted
       above, many participants are not active there, and some of those
       who are are able to amplify their positions in a way that may
       distort the 'reading of the room' as a result.

   3.  IETF participants who wish to make proposals about or discuss the
       IETF's direction, policy, meetings and procedures should do so in
       GENDISPATCH or other Working Group, if one more specific to that
       topic should exist.  Note that Working Groups can define policies
       for participation in their work.

   4.  IETF participants who wish to discuss technical issues should do
       so in the most appropriate Working Group or Area mailing list to
       the topic - ideally publishing an Internet-Draft to further that
       discussion as appropriate.  Note that topics without an obvious
       home, as well as cross-area topics, have been proven to be well-
       handled by the DISPATCH-style Working Groups.

   5.  Cross-area review should continue using a combination of review
       directorates, cross-participation, AD oversight and the Last Call
       discussion list.

   6.  There should be no explicit or implicit requirement for IETF
       leadership or any other person to be subscribed to the IETF

       discussion list.  Requiring participation in a toxic forum with
       no clear connection to the operation of the organisation is
       problematic.

   7.  Operational documents (such as
       https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/ [5],
       https://www.ietf.org/how/lists/ [6] and
       https://www.ietf.org/how/lists/discussion/ [7]) should be
       rewritten to reflect this understanding of the role of the IETF
       discussion list.  In particular, newcomers to the IETF should not
       be steered towards subscribing to the IETF discussion list.
       Likewise, presentations to new IETF participants should be
       updated.

   8.  Operational documents should be updated to indicate the role of
       the DISPATCH groups more clearly to newcomers.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of the Internet had better not depend upon the IETF
   discussion list.
